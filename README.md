# {‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù} üëã

My name is **Vit√≥ria** (or **Nico**), I have a bachelor's degree in biological sciences from the renowned S√£o Paulo State University 'J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho' (Unesp) and I'm an aspiring data scientist.

During my undergrad, I dabbled a bit in chemometrics with design of experiments(DoE) to develop environmentally friendly technologies (~~yes, a lot of statistics~~ ).
After a major turn in my life related to my health, I decided to switch careers to tech and found data science, which brought back what I loved most as a biology researcher.

Here I am, sharing personal projects and lots of learning‚Äîhope you like it!

Oh, before I forget:

> üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà I am non-binary (_i go by any pronouns_) and autistic;

>üìö I love studying and learning new things;

>üê± I'm passionate about cats;

>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Luffy's the man who will become the Pirate King!
