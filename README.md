# {‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù} üëã

Hey! My name is Vit√≥ria (or just Nico), I hold a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the renowned S√£o Paulo State University 'J√∫lio de Mesquita Filho' (Unesp). During my undergrad, I delved into the world of analytical chemistry and phytotherapy, heavily utilizing chemometrics and design of experiments (DoE) to develop robust models that reduced the number of tests needed to create new technologies aligned with the principles of green chemistry (yes, a lot of statistics) _(You can check my published articles [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5983-2528).)_. 

After a major life change related to my health, I decided to switch careers to the tech field. I am currently an undergraduate student in Analysis and Systems Development and pursuing an MBA in Data Science and Analytics, aiming to become a data scientist. In data science, I found what I loved most as a biology researcher: being challenged with complex problems and seeking innovative solutions.

And here I am, sharing personal projects and lots of learning. Hope you like it!

Oh, before I forget:

> üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà I am non-binary (_i go by any pronouns_) and autistic;

>üìö I love studying and learning new things;

>üê± I'm passionate about cats;

>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Luffy's the man who will become the Pirate King!
